Next, I conducted a deep dive into the customer demographics to understand the makeup of the customer base and how it changed over time. I also analyzed the profitability of each company, taking into account factors such as revenue, expenses, and profit margins.

After compiling and analyzing all of the data, I was able to make a recommendation on which company would be the best investment opportunity based on a variety of factors. I also provided detailed insights and recommendations for further research.

Conclusion
Overall, this project was a challenging but rewarding experience that allowed me to apply my data analysis skills to a real-world problem. By analyzing a large dataset and identifying key trends and insights, I was able to make informed recommendations that could help investors make better decisions.
